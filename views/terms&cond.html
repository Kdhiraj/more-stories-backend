<p>
    You should be aware that there are certain things that more real stories
    will not take responsibility for:
</p>
<p>
    Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active
    internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile
    network provider, but more real stories cannot take responsibility for the
    app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi,
    and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
</p>
<p>
    If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember
    that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will
    still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for
    the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
    app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
    responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you
    use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without
    turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
    which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
    received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
</p>
<p>
    Along the same lines, more real stories cannot always take responsibility
    for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device
    stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail
    the Service, more real stories cannot accept responsibility.
</p>
<p>
    With respect to more real stories responsibility for your use of the app,
    when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we
    endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely
    on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it
    available to you. more real stories accepts no liability for any loss,
    direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
    functionality of the app.
</p>
<p>
    At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
    available on Android, iOS &amp; KaiOS – the requirements for the system(and
    for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app
    to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
    using the app. more real stories does not promise that it will always
    update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android,
    iOS &amp; KaiOS version that you have installed on your device. However,
    you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to
    you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
    it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell
    you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to
    you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if
    needed) delete it from your device.
